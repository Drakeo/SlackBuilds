opensc (Tools and libraries for smart cards)

OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart
cards. Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic
operations, and facilitate their use in security applications such as
authentication, mail encryption and digital signatures. OpenSC
implements the standard APIs to smart cards, e.g. PKCS#11 API,
Windows Smart Card Minidriver and macOS CryptoTokenKit.
