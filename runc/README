runc (a CLI tool for spawning and running containers)

runC is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to
the OCI specification.  Containers are started as a child process of
runC and can be embedded into various other systems without having to
run a daemon.  runC is built on libcontainer, the same container
technology powering millions of Docker Engine installations.  runC
does not force you to have a particular workflow or deployment setup
it only requires a root filesystem and configuration.
